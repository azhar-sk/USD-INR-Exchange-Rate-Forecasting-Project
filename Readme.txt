The Data Provided is related to USD/INR Exchange Rates.
The objective is to understand the underlying structure 
in the dataset and come up with a suitable forecasting 
model which can effectively forecast USD/INR Exchange Rate
for the next 7 OR 15 OR 30 days.
This milestone was achieved by using LSTM Neural network model
with an RMSE value of approximately 0.02 USD.
The model was deployed using Flask.
This forecasting model can be used by import and export 
companies to understand currency movements according to 
their revenue expectations. 
In order to run the model you need to download the zip folder and 
run the App.ipynb file in jupyter notebook.
